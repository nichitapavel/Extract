Description
-------------------------

This is a Bash function called "extract" that is designed to extract a variety of file formats. It takes one or more arguments, each of which represents a file or path that needs to be extracted. If no arguments are provided, the function displays usage instructions.

The function uses a case statement to determine the appropriate extraction method for each file type, and then calls the corresponding command. For example, if the file is a ZIP archive, the function uses the "unzip" command to extract its contents.

If the file is not recognized as a valid archive, the function displays an error message and returns an error code of 1.

Before running the function, the value of the Internal Field Separator (IFS) is saved so that it can be restored at the end of the function. This is done to prevent unwanted word splitting and filename expansion when processing file paths.

Overall, this function provides a convenient way to extract a wide variety of archive formats using a single command, simplifying and streamlining the extraction process.

### Donation

Regardless of whether funding is obtained or not, I will persist in refining the script's capabilities because it brings me joy to witness people using it and achieving their goals. However, I would be grateful for any support you could offer in offsetting the costs of hosting the domain and the time spent programming, which would otherwise encroach on my precious family time.
